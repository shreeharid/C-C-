//Simple calculator 
//The concepts used to implement this program are of pointer to function
1. Functions for addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and display are initialised and declared.
2. The return type of these functions can be float or int.
3. In the main function 
	1. Declare the two numbers, answer variable, character for choice.
	2. Declare two function pointers (one for float type and another for void).
	3. Take the input variable values (two numbers and choice).
	4. Start switch statement with the choice.
	5. Assign the pointer to the fuction name based on the choice made.
	6. Store the returned value in variable of answer.
	7. display the answer using second pointer.
	8. Use of goto or while statement can help to loop the program.
